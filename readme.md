## Netflix Clone with Vanilla JS & TailwindCSS

A cool netflix clone app that displays a featured movie randomly on each page refresh, and a list of rows, each row contains specific movies like horror, romance, drama, and also Trending and Popular movies.

Using cutting-edge modern js syntax like async wait, error handling with try catch, component-based approach to keep things clean and neat.

I used the TMDB API, they have such a great documentation and their API is very easy to use. Create your account at https://www.themoviedb.org/.

Tailwind CSS is so easy to use to build cool beautiful eye-catching UIs.

I will drop a link very soon to see a live version of the site, I will deploy it on firebase!
